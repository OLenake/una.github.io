## Page Transitions

## Dark Themes

Users, especially those on mobile, have begun setting their user preferences to dark themes. And the pages we build need to reflect the desires of our users.

Implementing a dark theme is relatively painless with newly available media queries, especially if you've already used CSS custom properties for theming.

## Component-Based Design

While component-based design has been a clear trend over the past few years with JavaScript frameworks guiding the way, they will continue to be the standard for web development moving into 2021, more than ever.

Styling benefits of component-based CSS include a more streamlined codebase and performant load times.
